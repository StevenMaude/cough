# cough - circle of fifths memory tester
I'm currently trying to learn the circle of fifths; mainly for the purposes of 
[harmonic mixing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mixing).

It's useful to know the relative key, as well as the key's neighbours.

The basic order of fifths is pretty simple: FCGDAEB, but I still find trying 
to work out all the possibilities quickly

## Usage
Run `cough.py`; it randomly picks a key.

Figure out the relative key, and the keys that are one and two sharps/flats
away. Press the enter key, and the script will show you what the answers are.
